# Critter Contraption Control
This is a Node-based website used to control an Arduino. I used [Socket.io][1] as client-to-server communcation, [Johnny-Five][2] for Arduino control, and [node-cron][3] for the scheduled timers feature.

# Websites
The project website is here: [https://sites.google.com/a/punahou.edu/byee20/][4]

The CC Control website is here: [http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Firebird1029/CC-Control/blob/master/client.html][5]

Note: The website above does not actually control a pet feeder. It is for demonstration features only. The buttons and Prototype Designs work, but I replaced all Socket.io functionality with regular functions.
